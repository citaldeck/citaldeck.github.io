We orient our building to minimize direct exposure to the harsh midday sun, typically from the east and west. In tropical regions, a north-south orientation is often preferred, with main facades facing north and south to maximize daylighting while minimizing solar heat gain.
Vegetation and Greenery: Incorporate vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, and green roofs, into building designs to provide natural shading and evaporative cooling. Planting vegetation strategically around buildings can reduce solar exposure, enhance microclimate conditions, and improve overall environmental quality.
We design our building with deep roof overhangs and eaves to provide extensive shading to windows and exterior walls. This helps to reduce solar heat gain, protect building materials from direct exposure to sunlight, and create comfortable outdoor living spaces.

[Interviewer]: Welcome to our discussion about sustainable building design. Can you please explain how your buildings are oriented to minimize exposure to harsh midday sun?
</p>
<p>
[Interviewee]: Absolutely. In our designs, we prioritize minimizing direct exposure to the midday sun, which typically comes from the east and west. This is crucial for maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures and reducing the need for excessive cooling.
</p>
<p>
[Interviewer]: I see. And how does orientation change in tropical regions?
</p>
<p>
[Interviewee]: In tropical regions, we often prefer a north-south orientation. This means the main facades of the building face north and south. This allows us to maximize daylighting while minimizing solar heat gain, which is especially important in hotter climates.
</p>
<p>
[Interviewer]: Interesting. How do you incorporate vegetation into your building designs?
</p>
<p>
[Interviewee]: We incorporate vegetation such as trees, shrubs, and green roofs strategically around the building. This not only provides natural shading but also promotes evaporative cooling and improves overall environmental quality. By reducing solar exposure and enhancing microclimate conditions, we create more comfortable and sustainable spaces.
</p>
<p>
[Interviewer]: And how do deep roof overhangs and eaves contribute to your designs?
</p>
<p>
[Interviewee]: Deep roof overhangs and eaves are essential elements of our design. They provide extensive shading to windows and exterior walls, which helps to reduce solar heat gain. Additionally, they protect building materials from direct exposure to sunlight, prolonging their lifespan. Furthermore, they create comfortable outdoor living spaces where occupants can enjoy the benefits of nature without being exposed to harsh sunlight.
</p>
<p>
[Interviewer]: Thank you for sharing those insights into your sustainable building design approach. It's clear that careful orientation, vegetation integration, and thoughtful architectural elements all play crucial roles in creating comfortable and environmentally friendly spaces.
