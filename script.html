			<h3>Competition Intro</h3>
			<p>It is here a Monumental challenge awaits. The Penang State Administrative Center architecture design competition! 10 selected schools from Penang have answered the call each bringing their unique blend of creativity and expertise to the table their mission to design an iconic government building that not only meets the functional needs of a modern administrative Center but also celebrates Penang's rich cultural heritage and commitment to sustainability from integrating green spaces to embracing cutting edge technologies. These young visionaries are redefining what it means to build for the future get ready to witness the birth of new icon as the Penang State Administrative Center rises to shape the skyline and inspire generations to come. When we designed the Harmony Citaldeck we wanted it to retain the design language of Penang architecture such as predominantly white has tall columns and wood accents. We wanted it to look regal, grand, and stately, reflecting Penang's heritage buildings architecture yet looking modern and relevant.</p>

			<h3>Competition Categories: Position of the Administration Center</h3>
			<p>A student of the Penang State High School, Aisyah who aspires to be an architect talks about the positioning and accessibility of the building. Its north south orientation maximizes daylight while minimizing solar heat. Greenery such as trees shrubs and green roofs provides natural shading while deep roof overhangs offer further protection.
			</p>
			<p>
			We prioritize physical accessibility with features like ramps elevators and wide doors. Universal Design principles such as lever door handles adjustable height counters and easily accessible controls ensure inclusivity for individuals of all abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
			Public areas are conveniently located near the entrance and offices are organized into function clusters to minimize unnecessary movement between workstations. This intuitive and streamlined design of our building enhances accessibility and operations for everyone.</p>

			<h3>Competition Categories: Facilities Consideration of Function Space</h3>
			<p>The building will feature a three-story underground car park integrated into the landscape with openings in the walls for natural ventilation the layout mirror office levels with direct elevator access ensuring swift journeys to service counters. Two separate rings allocate spaces for employees and the public enhancing accessibility disabled parking is strategically placed near entrances located on Floors 5th through 7th it optimizes space and ventilation. Additional double story underground parking minimizes fuel consumption for short visits. Smart sensors guide visitors to available spots streamlining the parking experience.
			</p>
			<p>
			The government building boasts a range of amenities catering to both the public and employees. It includes retail stores museums or science centers for educational visits lecture theaters for talks and presentations and an indoor sports center offering activities like basketball badminton and an indoor gym. The Concourse serves as the central hub for various events and gatherings. For working mothers there's a convenient daycare playground where they can drop off their children while attending to their responsibilities.
			</p>
			<p>
			It also offers a variety of dining options spread across its floors. The fourth floor hosts a food court while the basement features food stores for convenient access. Additionally minor food stalls are situated on the eighth floor providing quick bites. Restaurants and cafes can be found on the first floor and other floors throughout the building ensuring visitors and employees have ample choices for dining. </p>

			<h3>Competition Categories: ESG Incorporation</h3>
			<p>Our urban architectural design prioritizes environmental sustainability through passive energy efficient features, rooftop solar panels which we aim to save up to 75% of the building's energy usage, LED lighting rainwater harvesting systems for water conservation and the use of locally sourced sustainable materials additional eco-friendly initiatives such as green roofs, electric vehicle charging stations, and on-site waste management programs, further enhance our sustainability efforts.
			</p>
			<p>
			Situated in a diverse urban setting our building serves as a versatile hub for civic engagement and public services. It offers adaptable community and public spaces including a multi-purpose hall, exhibition areas, community centers, libraries, recreational facilities, and landscaped outdoor gathering areas. These spaces are meticulously designed to promote social cohesion, encourage community interaction, and facilitate cultural exchange among residents, thereby enriching neighborhood life.
			</p>
			<p>
			Adhering to local building regulations our structure maintains a 60% buildup area and stands at a height of 10 stories or 45 M due to its proximity to the airport.</p>

			<h3>Competition Categories: Overall Synergy of the Design and Concept</h3>
			<p>Reflecting the grandeur of Penang's historic architecture, tall ceilings create a sense of spaciousness and airiness inviting guests to experience a feeling of openness and freedom. While tall ceilings can create a sense of spaciousness and visual appeal, they may increase construction costs in energy consumption for heating and cooling. However they can also allow for better air circulation and accommodate tall structures like tall columns.
			</p>
			<p>
			Transparent glass walls establish a visual connection between the interior and exterior, blurring the boundaries to welcome the lush tropical garden landscape. They facilitate the influx of natural light into the building forging a harmonious bond with nature. However glass walls may pose challenges in terms of insulation privacy and maintenance. They also require careful consideration of shading to prevent excessive heat gain and glare.
			</p>
			<p>
			Paying homage to Penang's Heritage building design language a predominantly white color palette dominates the interior space evoking a sense of purity simplicity and timeless elegance while also serving as a neutral backdrop for other design elements. A predominantly white color palette can create a bright clean and timeless aesthetic. It may however require more frequent cleaning to maintain its appearance and could potentially highlight imperfections in surfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
			Structural elements such as tall columns add a touch of grandeur and sophistication echo's classical architectural style seen in Penang's Heritage buildings while also providing visual interest and rhythm throughout the space. These tall columns may require additional engineering to ensure structural integrity and stability. They could also impact spatial layouts and interior design choices.
			</p>
			<p>
			Nestled amidst a lush tropical garden landscape our oasis celebrates the natural beauty of Penang with rooftop plants and indoor greenery at every level creating a tranquil sanctuary for occupants to enjoy. While incorporating biophilic design principles enhances the overall sense of well-being and air quality, it requires careful planning for irrigation drainage, ongoing care, and maintenance. They may also bring in moisture and weight considerations to the building structure.
			</p>
			<p>
			Indoor wood panels or wall claddings infuse the space with a sense of warmth comfort and sophistication while complimenting the tropical surroundings. It also adds texture and depth to the predominantly white interior while paying homage to traditional craftsmanship. For the material we use engineered wood which offers a cost-effective alternative to solid wood while providing stability against moisture and temperature fluctuations. They are easy to install maintain customize and contributes to a sustainable and stylish environment.
			</p>
			<p>
			Glossy floors harmonizes aesthetically with a predominantly white pallette and glass walls creating a cohesive aesthetic that exudes elegance and luminosity. The reflective nature of glossy floors amplifies the natural light pouring in through skylights and glass walls further illuminating the interior spaces. Glossy floors are made from durable materials such as polished concrete epoxy resin highquality ceramic tiles or even marble and granite. They are generally easier to clean keeping floors looking pristine especially in high traffic areas.
			</p>
			<p>
			Abundant skylights and strategically placed glass walls maximize the influx of natural light creating a bright and airy atmosphere throughout the space while also reducing the need for artificial lighting. Skylights and natural light contribute to energy savings occupant well-being and visual comfort but must be carefully positioned in size to minimize heat gain glare and privacy concerns. They also require periodic cleaning and maintenance to ensure optimal performance.
			</p>
			<p>
			Thoughtfully designed with generous space in restrooms, car parks, and walkways, our facilities ensures the utmost comfort for visitors and occupants alike an element that cannot be overstated. While providing generous space and amenities ensures users are not stressed out and have the peace of mind when visiting the center, it requires careful planning to optimize functionality circulation accessibility and energy efficiency.</p>

			<h3>Our Journey: Group Effort and Discussions</h3>
			<p>We started this project with discussions we talked about what our building is going to feature and what makes it a good design. We did our research and survey on various similar buildings online.</p>

			<h3>Tool Use and Design Process</h3>
			<p>Hi my name is Ai Hun Seung. I like doing the design for the Harmony Citaldeck. After after school I would spend hours working on the drawing I started by doing sketches on paper to see how certain concepts fit with others then I will create a simulation and 3D models using my computer for a better visualization. The software that I use is called Micro Station. It's in Micro Station where I create all my 3D models. Micro Station is a CAD software that gives me all the tools and precision I need to turn my drawings into 3D models. I will then feed my model in LumenRT in order to generate the people in traffic. This is what it looks like pre-rendering and this is what it looks like post rendering.</p>

			<h3>Website</h3>
			<p>My name is Sarah and I am in charge of our project's website I do the design as well as create the web pages you can learn more about our submission on our website which is located at psyblade.github.io.</p>

			<h3>Experience: What We Gained From This Competition</h3>
			<p>In this competition we learn a lot of skill sets skill sets that would help help us in our school as well as our careers in the future.
