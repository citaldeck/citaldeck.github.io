			<h3>Why Learn Generative AI</h3>
			<img src="./imgs/learn/workforce1.jpg">
			<p>
			<br><br>
			If AI can provide answers to all our inquiries by simply typing in query in the prompt, then what is there to learn about generative AI? 
			<br><br>
			Just because everyone has access to AI, does not mean everyone knows how to harness the power of generative AI.
			<br><br>
			Consider this scenario: Give an average person a team of 10 people or employees, he or she may not know how to utilize them effectively. But if you give a seasoned businessperson the same team, he or she would likely be able to leverage their skills to create successful products or generate significant revenue.
			<br><br>
			AI functions akin to the employees you're provided with. Without understanding how to leverage their capabilities, you risk falling behind. In this new era of AI, it's not merely about automating tedious processes but rather about mastering the ability to command AI effectively, providing input, and rapidly automating tasks to achieve precise outcomes.
			<br><br>
			What we teach is the art of crafting prompts, utilizing keywords, and the 'flow' which is orchestrating a sequence of steps to harness results from various prompts and shape them into the desired outcome, and put your ahead in the age of AI.

			<h3>Do We Learn When We Use AI?</h3>
			<p>
			Yes, let's say you are task with coming up from a script for a presentation. Instead of writing it yourself, and being done with it because you do not have the time to rewrite another one, or perhaps you do not possess the flair to come up with anything better, you can now perform a higher-level job of picking the best out of the essays that the AI give you. Now that you are freed up from the actual writing process, you can now raise the bar and select what goes into the presentation. If you are not happy with the essay the AI gives you, you can feed the AI more input and guide it to give you what you want. Subconciously in the process, your writing will actually get better because you have read so many top quality essays, and you now have the ability to critique it, know what is really important in an essay (i.e, the relavace of the facts, tone, emotions, flair, etc.), and you know exactly what and where to improve it. Perhaps you might think the script that the AI gave you is too boring, or too sales-like. Now with AI you have the power to tweak all that!
